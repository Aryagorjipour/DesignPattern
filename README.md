# Design Pattern

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in [programming language(s) to be specified].
## Patterns Implemented

-    **[Observer Pattern]**: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
-    **[State Pattern]**: This pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is useful when an object's behavior is dependent on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime.
## Getting Started
